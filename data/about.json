    "text": "I'm a Software Engineer at Google working with the Fitbit Premium teams in Warsaw. I used to work at Intuit before on their Document Extraction team. Outside of work, music is my escape. I enjoy learning theory of classical music and can play a few instruments. Currently I'm practicing a beautiful Indian instrument called the Veena. Sometimes, I dabble in digital design. Ping me to chat about my projects, product ideas, UX or XR."
