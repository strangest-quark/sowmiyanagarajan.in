    "text": "I'm a full-stack engineer at Intuit, currently working in Doc comprehension team. I contribute to extraction capabilities of financial documents across products like Turbotax, Quickbooks and Mint. Out of office, music is my constant escape. I enjoy learning theory of classical music and can play a few instruments. Currently I'm practicing a beautiful Indian instrument called the Veena. Sometimes, I dabble in origami and digital illustration. Ping me to chat about my projects, product ideas, UX or XR."
